			<h1>Ceramics</h1>
			<p>We do ceramics well. </p>
			<p>
				20 years ago the founders of Studio Redfield, Randy and Susanne, developed their first line of hand painted, abstract, ceramic dishware that would later be featured in Nordstroms and other outlets across the nation. Now the line is back, and is looking better than ever. These pieces paired with selections from local ceramicists make Studio Redfield a destination for those interested in the craft.

				<h1>Randy Redfield</h1>
				<p>
					Randy Redfield is a 5th generation Oregonian who resides and paints in Sisters. He received his BFA in painting from the University of Oregon in SOME DATE HERE.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Project 43 </em> is the working title of his current series of paintings done on wood panels as opposed to the traditional canvas. The procedure of creating many layers of paint combined with sanding and the use of an electric drill produce a textured color field that is signature to his modern pieces. This format has allowed him the freedom to push the dynamics of the surface to another level while creating a new fluidity in the making of his art.
				</p>
				<p>
					Considered a lifetime honor for Oregon Artists, in 2013 Randy was chosen to exhibit his work as part of the “Art in the Governor’s Office” program. His Colorful abstract works were displayed in the Governor’s reception area in the Oregon Capitol Building in Salem.
