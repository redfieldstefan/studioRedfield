			<h1>Hand Forged Cutlery</h1>
			<p>Hand forged blades are not easy to come by. Fortunately for us, we were able to get a local bladesmith on board and we now feature a selection of cutlery designed and forged by Chef's Forge. Learn more below.

				<h1>Chef's Forge</h1>
				<p>
					Artist and Blade Smith, Kyle Kotaich was inspired to make kitchen knives after catching rockfish on the Oregon coast and finding no suitable knife to cut through their thick skin. A craftsman at heart, his mind and hands began to work. He gathered old world tools to build a forge and bring his sharp creations into existence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each knife is made by hand at his home in Bend Oregon with locally sourced materials whenever possible. The blades are made with a durable 1095 spring steel that holds a sharp, long lasting, cutting edge.  The single bevel construction of the cutting edge makes for a perfect straight cut and improves cooking workflow by moving cut pieces away from the blade.
